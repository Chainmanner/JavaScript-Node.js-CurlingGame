# JavaScript-Node.js-CurlingGame
A game of curling that I made for a school assignment in the second year of university. This assignment has no base code from the instructor at all - entirely designed by me. NOTE: There are other JavaScript/Node.js projects that I have made, but this is the only one I'm able to upload.
