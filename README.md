# JavaScript-Node.js-CurlingGame
A game of curling that I made for a school assignment in the second year of university. This assignment has no base code from the instructor at all - entirely designed by me.

# NOTE
There are other JavaScript/Node.js projects that I have made, but this is the only one I'm able to upload since the others contain copyrighted material of which cannot be easily removed.
